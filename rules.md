# CHAPTER I: GENERAL PROVISIONS

## Section 1: Adoption of Robert’s Rules of Order
The START Board has adopted “Robert’s Rules of Order” as its guideline for parliamentary procedure. These rules should be followed whenever possible to ensure proper and orderly conduct of START Board meetings. In cases where a conflict arises between the procedures outlined in the Wyoming Statutes and those in “Robert’s Rules of Order,” the procedures established by law take precedence.

## Section 2: Suspension of Rules
The START Board has the authority to suspend any rules it has the power to adopt, including those contained in “Robert’s Rules of Order.” If the START Board acts in violation of such rules, those rules are deemed suspended, and the actions taken are not invalidated by the failure to comply.

## Section 3: Precedence of Rules
This document is a compilation of applicable parliamentary laws and the rules and procedures adopted by the START Board. Where any rules herein conflict with “Robert’s Rules of Order,” the rules in this document take precedence and are considered amendments to Robert’s Rules.

# CHAPTER II: RULES AND PROCEDURES

## Section 1: Types of Meetings

START Board meetings may be categorized as follows:

### a. Regular Meetings
Regular meetings are held in accordance with the START Board Bylaws.

### b. Special Meetings
Special meetings are held in accordance with the START Board Bylaws and may be called under the following circumstances:

1. **Chairperson Determination**:
   - When the Chairperson sets a special meeting, the Transit Director or their designee informs all START Board members individually about the meeting details and handles public notification, staff notification, and agenda preparation.

2. **Majority of the START Board Determination**:
   - If a majority of the START Board requests a special meeting, a representative of the majority contacts the Transit Director or their designee, who then informs all board members individually about the meeting details and manages public notification, staff notification, and agenda preparation.

Actions taken during emergency meetings are temporary and must be reconsidered and approved in an open public meeting within forty-eight (48) hours.

### d. Executive Sessions
Executive sessions are portions of meetings closed to the public, requiring a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the members present. These sessions are held when the nature of the business demands privacy. Before adjourning to an executive session, the START Board must convene a regular meeting.

### e. Electronic Meetings
Board meetings may be conducted electronically or through other communication methods as per Wyoming State Statutes. START makes all reasonable efforts to hold in-person meetings.

- Comply with Wyoming State Statutes.
